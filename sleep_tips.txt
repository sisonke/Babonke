Lack of sleep.

Sleepiness Causes Accidents
	Studies show that sleep loss and poor-quality sleep also lead to accidents and injuries on the job. In one study, workers who complained about excessive daytime sleepiness had significantly more work accidents, particularly repeated work accidents. They also had more sick days per accident.

Sleep Loss Dumbs You Down
	Sleep plays a critical role in thinking and learning. Lack of sleep hurts these cognitive processes in many ways. First, it impairs attention, alertness, concentration, reasoning, and problem solving. This makes it more difficult to learn efficiently.Second, during the night, various sleep cycles play a role in “consolidating” memories in the mind. If you don’t get enough sleep, you won’t be able to remember what you learned and experienced during the day. 

Sleep Deprivation Can Lead to Serious Health Problems
	Sleep disorders and chronic sleep loss can put you at risk for: Heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, stroke and diabetes.

Lack of Sleep Kills Sex Drive
	Sleep specialists say that sleep-deprived men and women report lower libidos and less interest in sex. Depleted energy, sleepiness, and increased tension may be largely to blame.

Sleepiness Is Depressing
	Over time, lack of sleep can contribute to the symptoms of depression. Sleep loss often aggravates the symptoms of depression, and depression can make it more difficult to fall asleep.
